    "You are all welcome to the first session of this reintroduction of **Bot Party** organized by Devamplify. Thanks for being here üôè. The purpose of this party is to learn about Artificial Intelligence specifically Machine Learning.  \n",

    "For you to implement an machine learning algorithm on a computer, you need to use a programming language. Now, you can use any programming language for implementing machine learning algorithms but for the purpose of this class, we will be using the **Python Programming Language**. The reason we are using Python is because it's a fun, approachable, ubiquitous language and a lot libraries that make it easy to do Machine Learning are implemented in Python.  \n",

    "## Introduction To Python Programming Language\n",
    "Python Programming Language is a simple to use but very powerful programming language. It can be used for a wide variety of tasks e.g automation of computer activities, web development, game development and of course Artificial Intelligence üòú. Please note that this session won't cover Python exhaustively, it will just cover those parts that are relevant to the purpose of this Bot Party. If you want to learn more about Python, you can read the python tutorial section of the documentation that comes with every python software. Let's begin.  \n",

    "### Using Python as a mathematical tool\n",
    "Most of the time, I find that it's easier for me to just use python as a calculator instead of the calculator that comes with my computer or phone, \"Why?\" you might ask, because it's easier. Let me show you a few examples:  \n",
